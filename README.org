A widget to get re-narrations for the site that the widget is added in.
Add *embed.js* to the page in which the widget has to be activated.

AlipiWidgetView, when instantiated gets the language choices of available
re-narrations.

Populate the Renarrations collection by making a call like

Renarrations.getAll({"what": <choice of language>,
                       "where": encodeURIComponent(window.location.href),
                       "success": function(data) {
                         _.each(data['r'], function(item) {
                           _.each(item['narration'], function(narration) {
                             Renarrations.add(narration);
                           });
                         });
                       }});

Renarrate() accepts a collection of swts as argument, and iterates over the
collection to replace relevant DOM objects.
